The given width is 6, so the first row is the numbers 0 through 5.
The each number in the next line is the sum of 3 numbers to the left and above it.
(The far left column only adds the number above it since there are no numbers to the left of it)
Moving to the right on the second line:

0 + 1 + 0 = 1

1 + 2 + 1 = 4

2 + 3 + 4 = 9

3 + 4 + 9 = 16 (mod 10) = 6

4 + 5 + 6 = 15 (mod 10) = 5

This is continued until line 4, the line Wyatt wanted to know about.
